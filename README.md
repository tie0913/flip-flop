# Overview 

This is a project set for studyingprogramming languages and frameworks in VSCode. I will try to make each part clear and make more notes and comments as much as possible.

## Why do I use VSCode?
I have used InteliJ for several years. But I am always confused by all kinds of settings and issues which are not sovled easily. When I was a student, I saw my tutor developing his side project in VIM and linux command line, and he explained that he wants to understand every details of his project, including directory structure, environment variables, building procedures, making runnable packages, and so forth. I think I might need doing this too and fortunately we have VSCode today.
